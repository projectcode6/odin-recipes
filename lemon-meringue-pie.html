            <li>100g cold butter, cut in small pieces</li>
            <li>1 tbsp icing sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>For the filling</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 level tbsp conflour</li>
            <li>100g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 large lemons, zested</li>
            <li>125ml fresh lemon juice (from 2-3 lemons)</li>
            <li>1 small orange, juiced</li>
            <li>85g butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks and 1 whole egg</li>
        
        </ul>

        <h2>For the meringue</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 egg whites, room temperature</li>
            <li>200g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp cornflour</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                For the pastry, put the plain flour, butter, icing sugar,
                egg yolk (save the white for the meringue) and 1 tbsp cold 
                water into a food processor. Pulse until the mix starts to
                bind – make sure the mix is not overworked.</li>

            <li>
                 Tip the pastry onto a lightly floured surface, gather 
                 together until smooth, then roll out and line a 23 x 2.5cm
                 loose-bottom fluted flan tin. Trim and neaten the edges. 
                 Press pastry into the flutes. The pastry is quite rich, 
                 so don’t worry if it cracks, just press it back together.
                 Prick the base with a fork, line with foil, shiny side
                 down, and chill for 30 mins-1 hr (or overnight).</li>

            <li>
                Put a baking sheet in the oven and heat the oven to 
                200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bake the pastry case ‘blind’ 
                (filled with dry beans) for 15 mins, then remove the 
                foil and bake a further 5-8 mins until the pastry is
                pale golden and cooked. Set aside. Can be done a day 
                ahead. Lower the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>

            <li> While the pastry bakes, prepare the filling. Mix
                 the cornflour, golden caster sugar and lemon zest 
                 in a medium saucepan. Strain and stir in the lemon
                 juice gradually. Make the orange juice up to 200ml 
                 with water and strain into the pan. Cook over a medium
                 heat, stirring constantly, until thickened and smooth.</li>

            <li>Once the mixture bubbles, remove from the heat and beat
                the butter until melted. Beat the egg yolks (save white
                for meringue) and the whole egg together, stir into the 
                pan and return to a medium heat. Keep stirring vigorously 
                for a few minutes, until the mixture thickens and plops from 
                the spoon. (It will bubble, but doesn’t curdle.) Take off
                the heat and set aside while you make the meringue.</li>

            <li>Put the egg whites in a large bowl. Whisk to soft peaks,
                then add 100g of the golden caster sugar a spoonful at a 
                time, whisking between each addition without overbeating.
                Whisk in the cornflour, then add the remaining 100g of
                sugar as before until smooth and thick.</li>

            <li>Quickly reheat the filling and pour it into the pastry case. Immediately 
                put spoonfuls of meringue around the edge of the filling (if you start in
                the middle, the meringue may sink), then spread so it just touches the pastry
                (this will anchor it and help stop it sliding). Pile the rest into the centre,
                spreading so it touches the surface of the hot filling (and starts to cook),
                then give it all a swirl.</li>

            <li>Return to the oven for 18-20 mins until the meringue is crisp and slightly 
                coloured. Let the pie sit in the tin for 30 mins, then remove and leave for
                at least another 30 mins-1 hr before slicing. Eat the same day.</li>
